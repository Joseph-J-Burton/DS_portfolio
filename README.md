## Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer Portfolio 

### Purpose  

This is a project to gather my Data Science and Machine Learning projects into one location.

### Description  

The projects, exercises, and games are projects from several on-line courses to help me have hands-on experience using the concepts from the lesson.  
Each project has it's own README.md file to describe the purpose and reference source.   
I selected these projects because I feel like these demostrate some of the skills that have been learned to perform data analysis and model generation.  

### Comments  

There are several projects that were not included, but I plan on continuing refining by adding comments for clarity and may include those in the future.
